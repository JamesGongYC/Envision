# Envision

Navigating Complexity: Enhancing Climate Policy Decision-Making Through Topological Analysis of Multi-Sector Systems

## Overview

Envision is a framework for parameter sampling and topological analysis of climate model outputs. It extends the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) with capabilities for exploratory modeling and advanced data analysis to support robust decision-making under deep uncertainty.

## Key Components

- **GCAM Extensions**: Enhanced parameter sampling capabilities for the Global Change Analysis Model
- **Topological Data Analysis**: Tools for extracting meaningful structures from high-dimensional model outputs
- **Interpretation Framework**: Methods for translating mathematical structures into policy-relevant insights

## Project Structure

- `gcam-core/`: The core GCAM model with extensions
  - `cvs/objects/sampling/`: Parameter sampling framework
- `analysis/`: Tools for topological data analysis and visualization
- `outputs/`: Storage for model outputs and analysis results

## Getting Started

1. Set up GCAM according to its documentation
2. Configure parameter sampling in `parameter_sampling_batch.xml`
3. Run batch simulations
4. Analyze results using the topological analysis tools

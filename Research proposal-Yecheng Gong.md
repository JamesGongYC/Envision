# **Navigating Complexity: Enhancing Climate Policy Decision-Making Through Topological Analysis of Multi-Sector Systems**

## **Executive Summary**

Climate policy decision-makers face a critical challenge: they must navigate immense complexity and deep uncertainty while making choices that will shape humanity's future for generations. Despite sophisticated models that simulate interactions between climate, energy, water, and socioeconomic systems, the outputs of these models—vast clouds of high-dimensional data points—remain largely impenetrable to those who most need their insights. This creates a dangerous disconnect between scientific understanding and policy implementation, often resulting in overly simplistic approaches to complex challenges.

This research proposes an innovative framework that combines topological data analysis (TDA) with large language models (LLMs) to transform complex model outputs into interpretable, actionable policy insights. By applying TDA's ability to detect meaningful structures in high-dimensional data and using LLMs to translate these mathematical findings into policy-relevant language, this framework will bridge the gap between computational complexity and human decision-making.

Drawing on my experience developing FireAIDSS (an AI-driven drone swarm for wildfire monitoring) and my mathematical background in algebraic topology, I am uniquely positioned to develop this interdisciplinary solution. The project will deliver an open-source framework, visualization tools, and case studies demonstrating practical applications to climate policy questions, ultimately enabling more robust, evidence-based decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty.

## **Problem Analysis**

### **Problem Statement**

Climate change presents an existential challenge characterized by deep uncertainty—a state where traditional predictive models falter because we lack historical precedent for many possible futures. As I discovered while exploring climate modeling literature, these systems are fundamentally chaotic, meaning slight variations in initial conditions or parameters can lead to drastically different outcomes. This uncertainty is compounded when we consider the complex interactions between climate, energy, water, agriculture, and socioeconomic systems.

Current approaches to climate policy modeling use sophisticated multi-sector dynamics (MSD) models to explore these interactions across thousands of possible futures. However, these models produce massive high-dimensional datasets that overwhelm human cognitive capacity. The interpretability problem this creates has three critical consequences. First, valuable insights remain trapped in complex model outputs, inaccessible to policymakers who need them most. Second, climate discourse becomes polarized between apocalyptic and denialist narratives, overlooking the nuanced middle ground where effective action lies. Third, without clear understanding of complex system dynamics, policymakers default to simplistic policies that fail to address the interconnected nature of climate challenges.

This problem is particularly pressing because decisions made today about climate policy will have profound and persistent impacts on future generations. The contingent nature of these decisions—where small variations in approach can lead to dramatically different outcomes—makes it imperative that we develop better tools for navigating complexity under uncertainty.

### **Current Landscape**

The field of decision support for climate policy currently relies on several approaches, each with significant limitations. Traditional scenario analysis presents a small set of predefined futures to evaluate policy options. While accessible, this approach artificially constrains uncertainty and may miss critical vulnerabilities, as demonstrated by numerous studies in climate risk assessment.

Exploratory modeling has emerged as a powerful method for analyzing systems under deep uncertainty, systematically exploring many possible futures to identify robust policies. However, as Moallemi et al. (2020) note, "current exploratory modeling approaches do not provide much guidance for how their outputs should be interpreted," leading to a "gap between results and decision-making."

Robust Decision Making frameworks help identify decisions that perform well across many scenarios, but their computational complexity can overwhelm users. According to Srikrishnan et al. (2022), "When exploratory modeling is used to investigate a wide range of assumptions through batch simulations, it can result in very large data outputs which need to be analyzed and understood in decision-making."

Visualization techniques attempt to make complex data comprehensible, but traditional approaches struggle with high-dimensional data. Even advanced visualization methods falter when dealing with the massive parameter spaces of coupled human-natural systems.

The critical gap in this landscape is the lack of methods that can systematically extract meaningful patterns from high-dimensional data and translate them into accessible insights without oversimplification. Recent mathematical advances in topological data analysis offer promising capabilities for identifying structures in complex data, but these methods have not yet been effectively combined with natural language generation to create interpretable insights for policymakers.

## **Research Plan**

### **Research Question(s)**

My primary research question asks how topological data analysis combined with large language models can enhance the interpretability of complex multi-dimensional outcomes from exploratory climate modeling, enabling more robust policy decisions under deep uncertainty.

This question breaks down into several important sub-questions. First, what topological features in multi-sector model outputs correspond to meaningful policy-relevant patterns and decision thresholds? Second, how can large language models effectively translate mathematical structures identified through TDA into natural language insights that policymakers can understand and act upon? Third, how does enhanced interpretability of model outputs influence decision-makers' ability to identify robust policies across diverse future scenarios? Fourth, what visualization approaches best complement TDA and LLM-generated insights to facilitate understanding of complex system behaviors?

These questions address a fundamental challenge in climate policy development: the inability to effectively extract and communicate actionable insights from complex models. By focusing on interpretability through innovative mathematical and computational methods, this research aims to transform how policymakers engage with scientific models.

**Methodology**

This research employs an interdisciplinary methodology that combines three powerful approaches. First, I will use exploratory modeling with the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)—a sophisticated integrated assessment model—to generate datasets representing thousands of possible futures under varying climate, technological, and socioeconomic conditions. This approach allows systematic exploration of the decision space (policy options) and uncertainty space (future scenarios) to identify robust solutions. I will configure GCAM to explore climate mitigation and adaptation scenarios across energy, agriculture, and water sectors, design a sampling strategy to efficiently explore the high-dimensional parameter space, generate an ensemble of model runs to create a comprehensive dataset of possible futures, and define relevant outcome metrics to evaluate policy performance across scenarios.

Second, I will apply topological data analysis, which provides unique capabilities for identifying meaningful structures in high-dimensional data. Unlike conventional statistical methods, TDA can detect non-linear relationships, loops, clusters, and other complex structures that often correspond to critical system behaviors. I will apply two primary TDA techniques: persistent homology to identify and quantify multi-scale topological features in the data, revealing how the "shape" of the outcome space changes across different parameter regions; and the mapper algorithm to create simplified representations of the high-dimensional data that preserve its essential topological structure while facilitating visualization. These techniques will help identify clusters of similar outcomes representing distinct future states, transition boundaries between different system states, critical decision thresholds that significantly alter outcomes, and robust policy regions that perform well across multiple scenarios.

Third, I will develop an LLM-enhanced interpretation framework to translate mathematical features into actionable insights. This involves creating a structured representation of topological features that can serve as input to LLMs, developing context-rich prompting strategies that incorporate domain knowledge about climate policy, designing an evaluation framework to assess the accuracy and usefulness of generated interpretations, and implementing a feedback mechanism to iteratively improve the quality of interpretations. This approach builds on recent advances in prompt engineering and domain-specific LLM applications, adapting them to the novel task of interpreting topological structures.

The integration of these methods creates a powerful new approach to climate policy analysis. By combining the mathematical rigor of TDA with the interpretive capabilities of LLMs, we can extract meaningful insights from complex models while preserving the nuance and sophistication needed to address deeply uncertain challenges.

## **Theory of Change**

### **Impact Pathway**

This research will transform how policymakers engage with climate models through a clear pathway from technical innovation to practical impact. The research will produce an integrated analytical framework combining exploratory modeling, TDA, and LLMs; interactive visualization tools for exploring multi-dimensional model results; open-source software implementing the framework; and case studies demonstrating application to specific climate policy questions.

These outputs will lead to immediate outcomes including enhanced ability to identify robust policies across diverse scenarios, improved communication between modeling experts and policymakers, more sophisticated understanding of system dynamics, tipping points, and threshold effects, and reduced cognitive burden when interpreting complex model outputs.

In the intermediate term, we can expect adoption of the framework by climate modeling teams and policy analysts, integration of insights into formal policy development processes, more nuanced public discourse about climate risks and responses, and education of next-generation policymakers in systems thinking approaches.

The long-term impact will include more robust climate policies that perform well under various future conditions, improved institutional capacity to address complex, interconnected challenges, reduced polarization in climate discourse through evidence-based middle-ground approaches, and enhanced resilience of human-natural systems to climate change impacts.

This impact pathway will be realized through strategic engagement with key stakeholders, including climate modeling research groups who can adopt and extend the framework, policy analysis teams within government agencies and international organizations, educational institutions training future policymakers and analysts, and public communication platforms seeking to explain complex climate science.

By providing tools that make complex models more accessible without sacrificing their sophistication, this research addresses a fundamental bottleneck in translating scientific understanding into effective action.

### **Risk Assessment**

While this research offers significant potential impact, several risks and challenges must be addressed. Technical risks include the possibility that TDA may not identify meaningful structures in certain types of model outputs. To mitigate this risk, I will test multiple TDA approaches and parameters and validate findings with domain experts. There is also a risk that LLMs may generate plausible but incorrect interpretations of topological features. I will address this by implementing rigorous verification processes and maintaining human oversight throughout the interpretation pipeline. Computational resources may limit the scale of exploratory modeling possible, which I will mitigate by developing efficient sampling strategies and leveraging high-performance computing resources.

Implementation risks must also be considered. Policymakers may resist adopting new analytical approaches, which I will address by engaging stakeholders early and demonstrating clear value through case studies. The framework may be perceived as adding complexity rather than reducing it, so I will focus on user experience and prioritize clarity in visualizations and explanations. Domain experts may question the validity of TDA-derived insights, which I will mitigate by validating findings with established methods and maintaining transparency about the limitations of the approach.

Broader risks include the possibility that enhanced tools may reinforce existing power dynamics in decision-making. I will address this by emphasizing accessibility and designing for diverse users with varying technical backgrounds. Focus on robust decision-making may inadvertently lead to excessive caution, so I will include metrics for both robustness and opportunity and highlight adaptive approaches. The approach may not transfer well to all types of climate-related decisions, which I will address by defining scope carefully and identifying the most appropriate applications.

By anticipating these risks and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, the research can maximize its positive impact while minimizing potential drawbacks. Regular assessment and adaptation will be built into the project timeline to address emerging challenges.

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Timeline**

In the first week, I will establish a strong foundation by reviewing literature on TDA applications in similar contexts, setting up the computational environment for GCAM and TDA tools, defining specific policy questions to explore through the model, and developing evaluation criteria for interpretability assessment. This initial phase is crucial for ensuring that the technical implementation aligns with the research goals and that appropriate metrics are in place to evaluate progress.

Week two will focus on initial exploration and data generation. I will generate baseline GCAM scenarios focusing on climate mitigation pathways, perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of model outputs, identify key dimensions and variables for topological analysis, and document the scenario space and initial observations. This work will provide the raw material for subsequent analysis while helping to refine the research approach based on initial findings.

The third week will be dedicated to TDA implementation. I will apply persistent homology to identify key topological features in the model output space, create mapper graphs to visualize the shape of the data, identify structures that appear to correspond to policy-relevant patterns, and develop preliminary visualizations of identified features. This phase represents the core mathematical component of the research, translating high-dimensional data into meaningful topological structures.

Weeks four and five will focus on LLM integration. In the first week, I will develop initial prompt templates for translating topological features to insights, test various approaches to describing mathematical structures in natural language, create a database mapping topological features to preliminary interpretations, and evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of generated interpretations. In the second week, I will refine prompt engineering based on initial results, develop an integrated pipeline connecting TDA outputs to LLM inputs, implement feedback mechanisms to improve interpretation quality, and test the pipeline on a broader range of scenarios.

In week six, I will develop an interactive interface for exploring topological structures and their interpretations, implement visualization components for interactive exploration, create documentation explaining how to interpret the visualizations, and develop a prototype for user testing. This phase translates the technical capabilities into a usable tool that can be evaluated by potential users.

Week seven will focus on validation and refinement. I will conduct user testing with domain experts, gather feedback on the interpretability and usefulness of insights, refine the entire pipeline based on feedback, and document strengths and limitations of the approach. This critical phase ensures that the technical work translates into practical value for the intended users.

In the final week, I will complete the integrated framework, prepare comprehensive documentation and user guides, develop case studies demonstrating application to specific policy questions, and create presentation materials and final report. This phase ensures that the research outputs are well-documented and accessible for future use and extension.

This timeline allows for systematic development of all components while building in time for iteration based on feedback and testing. The modular approach ensures that valuable outputs will be produced even if certain components prove more challenging than anticipated.

### **Resources**

This research will leverage several key resources to ensure successful implementation. For computing resources, I will utilize high-performance computing capabilities available through university resources for running GCAM scenarios, cloud computing for LLM API access (budgeted through research funds), and a local development environment for interface creation and testing. These computational resources are essential for handling the large-scale model runs and complex analyses required by the project.

I will employ several software tools, including the open-source GCAM model, TDA libraries such as Giotto-TDA, GUDHI, and Ripser, LLM access through Claude API or similar platforms (academic access available), and visualization frameworks like D3.js and React for web interface development. These tools provide the technical foundation for implementing the integrated framework without requiring custom software development.

Data sources for the project will include GCAM input datasets (publicly available), climate scenario datasets (RCP-SSP combinations), and policy option databases from previous literature. These datasets will provide the necessary inputs for generating exploratory scenarios and evaluating policy options.

Expert collaboration will be essential for ensuring the research addresses relevant policy questions and produces meaningful insights. I will engage with GCAM modeling experts (available through university connections), climate policy experts (connections through faculty advisor), TDA specialists (mathematics department resources), and leverage my own LLM prompt engineering expertise developed through experience and literature review.

Throughout the project, I will need to acquire additional skills in advanced TDA techniques beyond basic persistence diagrams, GCAM configuration for specific policy scenarios, and effective prompt engineering for specialized scientific domains. My background in algebraic topology from the Stanford University Mathematics Camp (SUMaC) Program II and AI project development as a national team member of the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence (IOAI) provides a strong foundation for acquiring these additional skills.

These resources are all readily accessible, making the project feasible within the proposed timeline and scope.

## **Personal Fit**

My interdisciplinary background uniquely positions me to tackle this complex research challenge. Through my participation in the Stanford University Mathematics Camp (SUMaC) Program II, I developed strong skills in algebraic topology—the mathematical foundation of TDA. This training allows me to understand both the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of topological methods to data analysis, giving me the mathematical foundation necessary to implement the core analytical components of this research.

As a national team member of the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence (IOAI), I gained substantial experience in AI project development. This experience directly applies to the LLM integration aspects of this project, particularly in prompt engineering and ensuring reliable AI outputs. My knowledge of AI systems will be crucial for developing the interpretation framework that translates mathematical structures into policy insights.

My work developing FireAIDSS, an intelligent drone swarm system for wildfire monitoring, gave me practical experience applying advanced technologies to environmental challenges. This project required me to integrate neural networks with physical systems and develop novel perception frameworks—skills directly relevant to bridging mathematical analysis with real-world applications. The challenge of translating between abstract mathematical concepts and concrete physical applications in FireAIDSS has prepared me for the similar challenge of translating between topological structures and policy insights in this research.

My interdisciplinary studies across mathematics, computer science, and environmental science have cultivated a systems thinking approach that is essential for understanding the complex interactions in coupled human-natural systems. This perspective allows me to see connections between seemingly disparate elements and design solutions that address root causes rather than symptoms.

These capabilities, combined with my demonstrated ability to overcome technical challenges (as shown in my FireAIDSS project), provide a strong foundation for successfully executing this research plan.

This research represents the convergence of my intellectual passions and moral convictions. I firmly believe that in the same way that we believe one slight change in the past could create ripple effects that alter the course of history, every single one of our actions today holds the power of shaping our shared future.

Climate change exemplifies this principle perfectly. The policies we implement today will shape the trajectory of human civilization for generations to come. Yet without better tools for navigating complexity and uncertainty, we risk making decisions based on oversimplified models or polarized narratives rather than a nuanced understanding of system dynamics.

This project aligns with my long-term goal of developing interdisciplinary solutions that build resilience to climate challenges. While my previous work on FireAIDSS focused on technological responses to immediate threats like wildfires, this research addresses the equally crucial challenge of developing better policy frameworks to prevent or mitigate future disasters.

I am committed to bridging the gap between technical innovation and practical implementation—between sophisticated mathematical analysis and accessible decision support. By developing tools that make complex climate models more interpretable, I hope to contribute to more informed, evidence-based climate action that addresses the complex interplay of environmental, social, and economic factors shaping our collective future.

## **Appendix: Alternative Approaches Considered**

In developing this research plan, I considered several alternative approaches. Machine learning classification could potentially identify patterns in model outputs without using topological methods. However, while ML approaches excel at prediction, they often struggle with interpretability—precisely the challenge this research aims to address. TDA offers advantages in identifying meaningful structures while preserving interpretability.

Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis could simplify high-dimensional data for visualization. However, these methods often miss important non-linear structures that TDA can detect. They also typically require predetermined feature selection, potentially overlooking important patterns.

Expert elicitation approaches could bypass computational methods entirely, relying on domain experts to interpret model outputs. While valuable, this approach lacks scalability and struggles with the sheer volume of scenarios in exploratory modeling. The proposed framework augments rather than replaces expert judgment.

Agent-based modeling could provide an alternative to GCAM for generating scenarios. While ABM offers advantages in representing emergent behaviors, integrated assessment models like GCAM provide more comprehensive coverage of climate-economy interactions and have established credibility in policy contexts.

After careful consideration, the integrated TDA-LLM approach offers the best combination of mathematical rigor, interpretability, and practical applicability to the challenge of climate policy development under deep uncertainty.
